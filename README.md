# Earplugs
Autohotkey script forked from kristoffer-tvera/mute-current-application, modified for use as 'earplugs' in PUBG although it works for anything. Many thanks to Kristoffer Tver√• for saving my ears.

I have been using this since the release of PUBG since I found certain sounds too loud.

What it does: Sets the system volume of the current application to a high and low preset.

How to use it: Download and run Earplugs.ahk. 

VA.ahk and Earplugs.ahk need to be in the same directory.

Generally I toggle it while driving, or when the plane flies overhead.

Volume toggle is defaulted to 100% and 17%.
[Volume can be changed here](AHK/Earplugs.ahk#L4)
Note: These values are expressed in decimal with 1.0 being 100%.

Earplugs is set to Mouse4 by default, as well as Shift + Mouse4
[Keybind can be changed here](AHK/Earplugs.ahk#L11)

Insert (by default) can be used to reload the changes if the script is running. 

List of Keys, Mouse Buttons, and Joystick Controls for AHK can be found here:
